The skills I learned today are highly applicable in various professional contexts. 
First of all, an elevator pitch is crucial for quickly conveying a value of a product or idea, its also applicable to sell an idea to our supervisor or colleagues.
User personas and user journeys are foundational and helpful in designing user-centric products and services. We can thus clearly visualise the design process and ensure that our solutions are aligned with user needs..
Prompt engineering techniques can enhance creative processes and streamline content generation, making it easier to produce high-quality outputs efficiently.
